# Chiks Golg's QA Challenge. 

This repository is part of the Chicks Gold QA Challenge, which will showcase the skills to design, implement and document manual and automated tests.

## Test plan

You can see the test plan layout in the "Test plan" file.

## Manual testing

In the "Test cases" file you can see the designed test cases and the results of their execution.
Test sets have been designed with their respective test cases to be implemented manually. They cover the functionalities requested in the Challenge.

## Automation testing

Automation has been implemented in two parts:

* API Automation: A workspace was created where each entity was organized into collections. Each endpoint was added there through a request, including tests through scripts to test the functionalities through Runners. For this, Datasets have been created, which can be obtained in the "Data set for Postman - JSON files" folder.

* Web Automation: Selenium has been used in conjunction with testNG and RestAssured for Web automation, using the POM design pattern.
